# Clash Royale session June 13th 2021

I didn't really try with Clash Royale again today, I haven't been too interested in it lately. Today, I only collected 3 epic cards for Epic Sunday (3x Giant Skeleton) and did nothing else. There was a new update today, and a new season, so I additionally received 1000 gold.

## Overview

See above.
