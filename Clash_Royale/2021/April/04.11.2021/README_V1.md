# Clash Royale session April 11th 2021

I had a very short Clash Royale session today and didn't do much. I did my usual Epic Sunday collection, along with a few failed battle attempts.

## Epic Sunday

I claimed 3 guards from the Epic Sunday free epic card deal. There was an offer to buy an epic chest for 10000 gold, but I didn't buy it, as I feel it is just a scam, and is only worth less than 1000 coins to me.

## 2v2

I did a few 2v2 battles today, but lost all of them.

## Collection

I collected 1000 coins from the new league event, and opened a gold chest today.

## Overview

See above.
