# Clash Royale session April 4th 2021

I had a normal length Clash Royale session today

## Game update redesign

The game was updated today, and there was a re-design. The classic look is now long gone, but the new look is a bit unique in its own way.

## Totally normal event

I did not do well on the event and stopped attempting due to all attempts resulting in loss

## 2v2

I did some 2v2 battles today and claimed a crown chest, and began unlocking a golden chest

## Overall

I had a good time, and made decent progress.
