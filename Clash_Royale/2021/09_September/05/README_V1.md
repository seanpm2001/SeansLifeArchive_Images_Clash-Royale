# Leaving the royale arenas

I am quitting Clash Royale, and leaving the arenas for good. In the past 9 days, I have decided upon cutting the following 11 games out of my schedule:

- [x] Restaurant story

- [x] Bakery story

- [x] Pet Shop story

- [x] Fashion story

- [x] Farm story

- [x] City story

- [x] Merge Plane

- [x] Clash Royale

- [x] Pocket Trains

- [x] Sky Burger

- [x] Idle Miner Tycoon

This is just the next game to go.

## Conclusion

Today (2021 September 5th) I didn't play this game (Clash Royale) as I have quit playing. This was done because I got tired of the game and its impact on my schedule, and felt like I got enough done here. There will be no further screenshots, unless something changes in the future.
